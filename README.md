# InvoiceCreator

## Overview
An invoice generating app for a mobile hose repair company.

##Technology
* React
* react-router
* semantic-ui-react


##Functionality
Users are able to sort through company database of parts with their correlated attachments and sizes.

Users can then add adjust/items in a cart. Once all items are added to the cart, the cart price can be modified using discounts and labor quantities.

Once cart is finalized invoices are generated to be reflected on backend.

## Layout/Design
The layout and design was created using Semantic's UI React library. I used their component templates for the modals, navbar, forms, buttons, inputs, and icons.
